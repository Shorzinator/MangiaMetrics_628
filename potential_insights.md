The choropleth maps provide a spatial visualization of demographic characteristics and restaurant density across
Pennsylvania ZIP codes. Here are insights drawn from the DP04 analysis:

1. **Housing Units and Restaurant Density**: The first map indicates that higher concentrations of restaurants are not
   uniformly distributed across areas with a high number of housing units. There are dense clusters of restaurants in
   specific locations, suggesting that factors beyond just housing density might influence where restaurants are
   located.

2. **Population Demographics - White**: The second map suggests a moderate correlation between areas with a
   predominantly white population and the presence of Italian restaurants. The restaurant density appears slightly more
   concentrated in these areas, hinting at potential cultural or demographic influences on the location choice for
   Italian restaurants.

3. **Overall Population Density**: The third map shows that restaurants are more densely located in areas with higher
   overall population densities. This correlation suggests that a larger potential customer base is a significant factor
   in choosing restaurant locations.

4. **Age Group - 25 to 34 Years**: The fourth map highlights a clear trend where the density of restaurants aligns with 
   areas that have a higher population of the 25 to 34 age group. This demographic is traditionally seen as a key market
   segment for the restaurant industry, likely due to their disposable income and social dining behavior.

5. **Median Age**: The fifth map presents a more varied distribution of restaurant density across different median age
   groups. There seems to be a concentration of restaurants in areas with a younger median age, potentially reflecting a
   younger demographic's preference for dining out.

Overall, the maps collectively suggest that while there is a correlation between restaurant density and demographic
factors such as age group and overall population density, the relationship is not uniform across the state. The
distribution patterns indicate that multiple factors are likely at play in the success and location strategy of Italian
restaurants in Pennsylvania. The insights from these maps can be further enriched by conducting statistical analysis to
quantify the observed patterns and identify other underlying factors that may be influencing these trends.
